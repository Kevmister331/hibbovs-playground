# Hibbovs Playground Project

## Rough Idea Proposal (subject to change) 

This project will be a memory capsule of our friend group throughout our years starting from elementary until we went off for university. 

This will be implemented in some sort of  interactive timeline, where you can scroll to see notable events/dates, and click into the image/symbol to find more details or a gallery of photos/videos. We can also create an individual section with all of our names, and you can click into each of us showcasing a profile describing who we are and you customize your page to however your heart desires.

We were brainstorming some artistic styles and I posted some links into the chat. This is a general idea so far and we are open to any feedback/ideas.
